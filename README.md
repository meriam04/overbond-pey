# Overview
This is my solution to the overbond-eng-test for PEY. The goal was to produce a scatter plot out of an unstructured data input. 


## How to Run
This solution was implemented in Python, so Python should be installed in order to run it. In the case that Python is not installed, here is a link to install it:

The input is designed to be a csv file, currently implemented with <code>'sample-input.csv'<\code>. In order to change the input, change the path to the file in line 16 of the code to be path of the desired input file. 
  
<code> with open('sample-input.csv', 'r') as csvfile: <\code>
