# Overview
This is my solution to the overbond-eng-test for PEY. The goal was to produce a scatter plot out of an unstructured data input. 


## How to Run
This solution was implemented in Python, so Python should be installed in order to run it. In the case that Python is not installed, here is a link to install it:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Additionally, the visualization was done using the MatPlotLib library. In the case that this is not already installed, please install is using the instructions here: https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/installing/index.html 


The input is designed to be a csv file, currently implemented with 'sample-input.csv' as shown below. 
  
```with open('sample-input.csv', 'r') as csvfile: ```

In order to change the input, change the path to the file in line 16 of the code to be path of the desired input file.
